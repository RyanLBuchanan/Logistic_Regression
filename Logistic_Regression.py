# Import dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('Social_Network_Ads.csv')
X = dataset.iloc[:, 2:4].values

# Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

print(y_train)

print(X_test)

print(y_test)

# Feature scaling
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
sc = StandardScaler()
X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = sc.transform(X_test)

print(X_train)

print(X_test)

# Train the Logistic Regression model on the Training set


# Predict a new result


# Predict the Test set results


# Make the Confusion Matrix


# Visualize the Training set results


# Visualize the Test set results
